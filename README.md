>>>>>>> parent of 5fb994a... readme updated
When it comes to organizing their class schedule, lectures/sections/labs materials and upcoming assignments/exams, students here at Faculty of Computer and Information, Cairo University are in a terrible mess. 
Students at FCI are scattered across many places. Some professors and TAs publish their announcements and materials on the faculty’s official website, others use a third-party website such as Acadox, and moreover some professors and TAs send the materials and announcements to a student who is supposed to deliver that to all the other students. Besides that, the faculty schedule is provided to students as just a plain document. Students lose track of assignments deliveries and quizzes that they have.
Also the faculty doesn’t provide a forum where the students can ask and discuss about things relating to their courses or things that aren’t clear for them or they just don’t understand. Students have to use social network websites such as Facebook to communicate which is so distracting and it won’t be appropriate for professors and TAs to answer the questions and help the students. 
So after all of that students are scattered between the faculty’s website, Acadox, Facebook, GDrive, Dropbox, Mega, etc… After all of that they can’t help being lost and unorganized.

Our app aims to help students stay organized by providing them with their schedule, depending on what year they’re in, their major, minor and the courses they have registered. The schedule will tell them what lectures/labs/sections they have and the location of these in the faculty lectures/sections halls and labs. If the student doesn’t know the location of his lecture or lab the app will help him and show him a map to where the lecture/section hall or lab is in the faculty. The Schedule will inform them if there’s any quizzes, exams or assignments delivery at a certain lab or lecture.
Also students receive notifications for new announcements, upcoming quizzes and assignments deliveries to help them keep track with their courses. Students will also be notified regularly to remind them of their assignments, quizzes and exams and urge them to do their studies and work before due date.  
The app will organize downloading and uploading materials and will provide each course’s lectures, sections and labs with its materials that was uploaded.
That’s not it the app will provide a forum for the students to communicate with each other. Students can help each other and what will be better is that now it will be appropriate for professors and TAs to enter the forum and answer some of these questions. The forum will be categorized and organized according to course, topic, etc...
The app will contain many more features that will help FCI students in many aspects.

Extra Stuff:
9-	The app will allow users (professors, students or TAs) to send private messages to any other user. This is not a chat service. The messages will be similar to emails with a title, body & attachments. Then we will develop on top of that a Profanity and Spam Filtering System. This will filter the messages before they’re received to ensure it doesn’t contain any spam, curses, inappropriate words, sexual references, etc… If a message is detected as spam, it’ll not be received and the user who sent it will be reported and warned.
10-	If an assignment or task will be delivered online. Our application will allow the students to upload their assignments solutions or tasks. The concerned professors and TAs will receive these solutions and check them out and put the grade for each student on our application.
11-	The app will have a history for each course which contains the course materials from previous years. Users can view and download the materials for this course for a user-specified previous year.

>>>>>>> parent of 5fb994a... readme updated

1-	The app client will be an android app (and possibly a website especially an Admin website).
2-	The app backend will be built using PHP with SQL database (possibly MySQL). The backend will be built using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) providing RESTful web services to be used in the front-end clients.
